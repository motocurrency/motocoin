What is Motocoin?
----------------
 Motocoin is a cryptocurrency utilizing an innovative proof-of-play scheme where coins
 can only be mined through manual human work - playing a 2D motorbike simulation game, which
 is different from Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies that use a proof-of-work scheme where
 miners must perform difficult computations and then use proof of that work to secure coin
 transactions and get their reward. 

Advantages:
 - No need for expensive mining hardware. All you need to mine is an average computer and
 some skills at computer games.
 - No energy is wasted on pointless mining computations.
 - It is more secure as it is almost impossible to perform a 51% attack and it would be
 very expensive to hire enough people, considering that most skilled players would rather
 mine Motocoin than destroy it.

Network parameters:
 - A new block is generated every 1 minute.
 - The initial reward is 20 motocoins per block.
 - The block reward gets halved every 1'000'000 blocks (every two years), but it will never
 be less than 0.4 motocoins per block.
 - Difficulty is adjusted every 2000 blocks.
 - ≈40 million coins are to be generated during the first 12 years and ≈200'000 coins per
 year after.
 - The 3 developers of Motocoin were each rewarded 150K motocoins, which ensured them a
 strong reason to support Motocoin. Portions of these coins will be used for bounties and giveaways.
